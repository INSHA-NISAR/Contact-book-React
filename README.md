  Section 1 (React App)
  
  To start creating React app first check whether node is installed in your system or not by firing below command on vs terminal
  
  $ node -v
  
 now create react by following command 
  
  $ npx create-react-app app_name
  
 this will take a little bit of time because it will install some dependensies files or packages
 
 here is one output screen
